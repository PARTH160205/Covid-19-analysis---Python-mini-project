# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a COVID-19 dataset to understand the spread and impact of the pandemic across different regions. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the project answers several analytical questions related to confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 data across different regions
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform region-wise aggregation of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases
- Answer analytical questions using Pandas
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – Data loading, cleaning, filtering, aggregation
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical and advanced plots

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded CSV file using Pandas
   - Checked dataset structure and summary

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing (NaN) values
   - Removed records with Confirmed cases less than 10

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Grouped data by region
   - Calculated total Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered cases
   - Applied filtering and sorting techniques

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Created bar charts and comparative plots
   - Used Seaborn for better visual representation

## ❓ Analytical Questions Answered
1. Number of Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered cases in each region
2. Removal of records where Confirmed cases < 10
3. Region with maximum number of Confirmed cases
4. Region with minimum number of Death cases
5. Total Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered cases in India till 29 April 2020
6. Sorting data:
   - By Confirmed cases (ascending)
   - By Recovered cases (descending)

## 📊 Key Insights
- COVID-19 impact varied significantly across regions
- Some regions recorded high confirmed cases but also strong recovery rates
- Data filtering improved clarity of analysis
- Visualizations helped identify patterns effectively

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python can be used for real-world data analysis. Through data cleaning, EDA, and visualization, meaningful insights were derived from COVID-19 data. The project strengthened skills in Pandas operations, data visualization, and analytical thinking.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
